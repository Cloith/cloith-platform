# Cloud-Native Real-Time Event Platform

# 📖 The Project
Project Cloith is a Cloud-Native real-time platform designed to showcase highly available, containerized infrastructure. By leveraging Microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration, the platform facilitates sub-second latency event streaming between a Node.js backend and a React frontend via an MQTT-over-WebSockets bridge.

# WebSocket Handshake Verification:

Manual Handshake Simulation
You can use powershell for this

Command 1:
* $headers = @{"Connection"="Upgrade"; "Upgrade"="websocket"; "Sec-WebSocket-Key"="SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ=="; "Sec-WebSocket-Version"="13"}

Command 2:
* Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://srv1154036.hstgr.cloud/mqtt" -Headers $headers -Method Get

Expected Output: StatusCode: 101 (Switching Protocols) This confirms the Gateway-to-Service bridge is functional and ready for real-time streams.

# 🚀 Roadmap
* [x] Establish K3s Cluster & NGINX Gateway Fabric

* [x] Implement WebSocket Protocol Switching via Gateway API

* [x] Connect Node.js Backend to MongoDB Atlas

* [ ] Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC): Provision server resources via Terraform.

* [ ] Observability: Deploy Prometheus/Grafana for real-time broker monitoring.
