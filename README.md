# Project Cloith Monorepo

# Project Jorunal

This repository isn't just a project; it is the culmination of my journey through the landscape of Software Engineering. It represents the bridge I built between writing code and managing the environments where that code lives.

What started as learning simple logic has evolved into a passion for "Systems Thinking." I realized that great software isn't just about the lines of code in an app—it’s about the security of the tunnel, the reliability of the deployment, and the automation that makes it all repeatable.
