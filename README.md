# Project Jorunal

This repository isn't just a project; it is the culmination of my journey through the landscape of Software Engineering. It represents the bridge I built between writing code and managing the environments where that code lives.

What started as learning simple logic has evolved into a passion for "Systems Thinking." I realized that great software isn't just about the lines of code in an app—it’s about the security of the tunnel, the reliability of the deployment, and the automation that makes it all repeatable.

🏛️ What This Monorepo Explores
This is my "Live Lab." I use this space to master the three pillars of modern engineering:

1.🛡️ Security & Zero-TrustExploring how to protect assets in a "Default-Deny" world.Concepts: Ephemeral tunnels, Secret Injection, Identity-based SSH.Tools: Tailscale, Bitwarden CLI.

2. 🏗️ Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)Moving away from "manual" clicks to "declarative" systems.Concepts: Configuration Management, Orchestration, Singleton guards.Tools: Ansible, Python, Linux Internals.
   
4. 💻 Software DevelopmentBuilding real-time, responsive applications that run on the infra I build.Concepts: WebSockets, Event-Driven Architecture, Microservices.Tools: Node.js, React, MQTT.
